# Machine Learning for DRAGNs

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe, making them a valuable tool for detecting distant objects and studying galaxy evolution. Estimating their redshifts can provide astronomers with key parameters for host galaxies, including size, luminosity, temperature, and mass. The identification of radio AGNs, particularly double radio sources associated with AGNs (DRAGNs), is increasing with large-area radio surveys like the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), conducted with the ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) telescope. However, as AGN detections rise, redshift estimation becomes more challenging. DRAGNs, in particular, can distort a galaxyâ€™s spectral energy distribution (SED), complicating feature identification and leading to inaccurate redshift estimates. 

This project uses data from the EMU Pilot Survey (EMU-PS) to test whether current Machine Learning (ML) methods can be applied to double-lobed radio galaxies. We build on the work of Luken et al. (2023), where four ML algorithms were tested on a compact radio source (CRS) dataset. The algorithms include k Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNz), and Gaussian Processes (GPz). We apply both regression and classification techniques on a sample of 2,270 manually classified DRAGNs to estimate photometric redshifts. To evaluate the methods and identify the most accurate ML approach, we use outlier rates $\eta_{0.15}$ and $\eta_{2\sigma}$, residual standard deviation $\sigma$, Normalised Mean Absolute Deviation (NMAD), Mean Square Error (MSE, for regression), and accuracy (for classification). 

We successfully reproduced the results of Luken et al. (2023), with only minor variations in NMAD for kNN and RF in regression. When applied to DRAGNs, all ML methods showed an overall increase in metric values compared to CRSs, as expected due to the complexity of our sources. Nevertheless, even the worst-performing algorithm predicted more than 85\% of DRAGNs accurately. Similarly to Luken et al., (2023), we found that kNN had the lowest percentage of catastrophic outliers, in regression. For classification tasks, however, we found ANNz to perform best in photometric redshift estimation of DRAGNs.
